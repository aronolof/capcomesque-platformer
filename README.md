This is a retro style platformer inspired by 8-bit Megaman.

Originally created in August 2015 during the Uppsala University summer course Introduction to Programming with Java.

Some minor tweaks added in January 2019 to adapt to Greenfoot's new HTML5 support.

The sounds effects have been generated at http://www.bfxr.net/.
The music is composed in FamiTracker.
The sprites have been drawn with http://www.piskelapp.com/.

The game can be run in-browser at https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/14719.
